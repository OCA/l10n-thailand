To use this module, you can create 2 ways:

* Create bank payment export from Payment
    #. Go to menu *Invoicing > Vendors > Payments*.
    #. Select payment > Action > Create Bank Payment Export

* Create bank payment export direct
    #. Go to menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Bank Payment Export*.
    #. Create > select payment or Click *Get All Payments* when you need all payment to export

**Note**: If you have configured and selected a bank payment template during the payment registration, 
the values will be automated in the bank payment export, and you can skip the following steps.


Afterward, follow these steps:

#. If you have a template, select it; otherwise, choose the bank, such as SCB, and add values in the 'Information Export' tab.
#. Click 'Confirm'
#. Review the data in Excel by clicking 'Export Excel'.
#. Click 'Export Text File', state will change to 'Done' and the text file is downloaded to your computer.
#. If a payment fails (after sending a text file to the bank), you can reject each line and generate a new document by clicking 'reject' on each line.

**Additional Notes**:

* Export Excel: To review information (.xlsx)
* Export Text File: To create a text file and send it to the bank (.txt)
* You will need the "Show Full Accounting Features" to see Bank Payment Export menu and Account Manager can confirm document
* You can 'cancel' a text file before sending it to the bank (difference with reject by bank)
