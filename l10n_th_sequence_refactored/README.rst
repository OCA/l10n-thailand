This module refactor the `ir.sequence` allowing more legends to be added with minimal code duplication and
adding `preview` fields on both `ir.sequence` and `ir.sequence.date_range` models.
the `preview` field is a computed fields that only visible in edit-mode of the form view works with `range_` and `range_end_`.
It helps users to check and validate the prefix, suffix, and padding configuration easily without a need to actually generate an actual document.

Adding more legends to `ir.sequence` requires an extension of an inner method `_interpolation_dict()`
of the `_get_prefix_suffix()` method. An extension of an inner method is impractical,
therefore this module override the `_get_prefix_suffix()` method
by moving the inner private method `_interpolation_dict()` to a private method.
Therefore, this allows another module to add more legends to the `ir.sequence`.

This modules works as a base module to other modules to add more legends to `ir.sequence`.
