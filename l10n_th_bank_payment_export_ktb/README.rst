your `KTB Company ID` and `KTB Sender Name` first:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Payments > Bank Payment Configuration*.
#. Select `Field` and add your value
#. Select `Journal` field, if you want to default on Bank Payment Export following journal
#. Check `default` field, if you want to default on Bank Payment Export menu

Usage
=====

To use this module, you can create 2 ways:

* Create bank payment export from Payment
    #. Go to menu *Invoicing > Vendors > Payments*.
    #. Select payment > Action > Create Bank Payment Export

* Create bank payment export direct
    #. Go to menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Bank Payment Export*.
    #. Create > select payment or Click *Get All Payments* when you need all payment to export

Then you can do following:

#. Select Bank *KTB* and add value on 'Information Export' Tab
#. Click 'Confirm'
#. Check data excel by 'Export Excel'
#. Click 'Export Text File', state will change to 'Done' and the text file is downloaded to your computer.
#. If a payment fails (after sending a text file to the bank), you can reject each line and generate a new document by clicking 'reject' on each line.

Note:

* Export Excel: To review information (.xlsx)
* Export Text File: To create a text file and send it to the bank (.txt)
* You will need the "Show Full Accounting Features" to see Bank Payment Export menu and Account Manager can confirm document
* You can 'cancel' a text file before sending it to the bank (difference with reject by bank)
