To use this module, you can create 2 ways:

    #. Create > select payment or Click 'Get All Payments' when you need all payment to export

After that, click 'Confirm' and save your payment as a text or excel file.

When you select 'Export Text File' the state changes to 'Done' and the text file is downloaded to your computer.

If a payment fails (after sending a text file to the bank), you can reject each line and generate a new document by clicking 'reject' on each line.

Note:

* Export Excel: To review information (.xlsx)
* Export Text File: To create a text file and send it to the bank (.txt)
* You will need the "Show Full Accounting Features" to see Bank Payment Export menu and Account Manager can confirm document
* You can 'cancel' a text file before sending it to the bank (difference with reject by bank)
