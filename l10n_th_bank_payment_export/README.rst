Configuration
=============

The template for bank payment export is used for automatic default configuration. Users can simply select the desired template, and they can also modify the values later.

1. Go to 'Invoicing > Configuration > Payments > Bank Payment Templates'
2. Create the desired template, and in each line, you can select the fields you want to have values. The values must be valid data in the system (in the case of selections).
3. After creating the template, when registering a payment, you will see the "Bank Payment Export Template" field. Users can select it, and when it comes time to perform the bank payment export, the system will automatically populate the values based on the selected template.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you can create 2 ways:

* Create bank payment export from Payment
    #. Go to menu *Invoicing > Vendors > Payments*.
    #. Select payment > Action > Create Bank Payment Export

* Create bank payment export direct
    #. Go to menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Bank Payment Export*.
    #. Create > select payment or Click 'Get All Payments' when you need all payment to export

After that, click 'Confirm' and save your payment as a text or excel file.

When you select 'Export Text File' the state changes to 'Done' and the text file is downloaded to your computer.

If a payment fails (after sending a text file to the bank), you can reject each line and generate a new document by clicking 'reject' on each line.

Note:

* Export Excel: To review information (.xlsx)
* Export Text File: To create a text file and send it to the bank (.txt)
* You will need the "Show Full Accounting Features" to see Bank Payment Export menu and Account Manager can confirm document
* You can 'cancel' a text file before sending it to the bank (difference with reject by bank)
