The template for bank payment export is used for automatic default configuration. Users can simply select the desired template, and they can also modify the values later.

1. Go to 'Invoicing > Configuration > Payments > Bank Payment Templates'
2. Create the desired template, and in each line, you can select the fields you want to have values. The values must be valid data in the system (in the case of selections).
3. After creating the template, when registering a payment, you will see the "Bank Payment Export Template" field. Users can select it, and when it comes time to perform the bank payment export, the system will automatically populate the values based on the selected template.
