To use this module, call the `find_reviewer_level` function on the `hr.department` object,
and provide the `level` attribute as an argument.

This function retrieves reviewers from the specified department and returns a user.

For example, Department AA has 3 Approvers:

- User A
- User B
- User C

and you need to find the reviewer at level 1, you can use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  rec.employee_id.department_id.find_reviewer_level(level=1)

The result will be User A.
