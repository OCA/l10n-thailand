This module address the undue tax requirement for Thailand

In Odoo, cash basis feature is being used to cover case of undue tax (due on payment).
This can answer the issue about undue tax in Thailand partially.
For customer invoice/payment, Odoo's cash basis alone is enough.

But for supplier invoice/payment and expense, where tax invoice number and tax date is given from vendor.
This module will provide ways for user to do so on vendor bill (for normal tax) and
in supplier payment (for undue tax which is due on payment).

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

With this, 2 new tax related fields will be introduced in account.move.tax.invoice

1. tax_invoice_number : Tax Invoice Number
2. tax_invoice_date : Tax Invoice Date

In customer invoice, both field will be defaulted by Odoo's document number and date.
But in supplier invoice, both field must be filled by user with tax invoice number and date from vendor.

Note: The new table account.move.tax.invoice is the main source of Thai VAT Report

- In Chart of Account, add new account for Undue Tax, if not already exists.
- As admin, add access rights ``Show Full Accounting Features``
- Go to Invoicing > Configuration > Settings and select ``Cash Basis``, this will open cash basis options in Tax master data
- Go to Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Taxes, create new undue tax for both sales and purchase

**Case Customer Invoice and Payment**
