This module address the undue tax requirement for Thailand

In Odoo, cash basis feature is being used to cover case of undue tax (due on payment).
This can answer the issue about undue tax in Thailand partially.
For customer invoice/payment, Odoo's cash basis alone is enough.

But for supplier invoice/payment and expense, where tax invoice number and tax date is given from vendor.
This module will provide ways for user to do so on vendor bill (for normal tax) and
in supplier payment (for undue tax which is due on payment).
